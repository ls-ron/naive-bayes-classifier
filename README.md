# naive-bayes-classifier

This is a project which attempts to group data into A, S, G, W from their corresponding descriptions using Naive Bayes Classifier.
<br><br>
I learnt how to implement a Naive Bayes Classifier class in Python to classify text into groups. By using data preprocessing, 're' stdlib regex, to normalise strings in the training data and making better analysis.

I came 49th out of 205 entrants in this university course's Kaggle competition with an accuracy score of 98.18% on the testing data. 
<br>
The difference between 49th and 1st place was about 1% accuracy: 99.18%
